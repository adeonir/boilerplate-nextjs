# NextJS Boilerplate

---

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) boilerplate based in the course [React Avançado](https://reactavancado.com.br).

## What is inside?

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## Getting Started

You can use this as a boilerplate:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/adeonir/nextjs-boilerplate

# or

yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/adeonir/nextjs-boilerplate
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- `export`: creates the production build version and exports to deploy
- `serve`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
